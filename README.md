Homework for Module 6-API

Part 1: WeatherPy


We created a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. We used the citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., and  problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.

Created a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Latitude vs. Temperature

Latitude vs. Humidity

Latitude vs. Cloudiness

Latitude vs. Wind Speed

Computed the linear regression for each relationship

Created a series of scatter plots:

Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

Part 2: VacationPy

In this deliverable, we used your weather data skills to plan future vacations. Also, used Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.
Created a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame
